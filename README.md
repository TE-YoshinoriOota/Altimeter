# Altimeter
Altimeter can measure more precise altitude using an IMU and a Barometer fusion filter than a system using only a barometer. This system consists of SPRESENSE, BMI270, and BMP581. BMI270 is an IMU board and BMP581 is a barometer.

The motivation for fusing an IMU sensor and a barometer is to get stable altitude data. 
An altitude measurement system using only a barometer is unstable because the air pressure is constantly changing. 
For example, the air pressure is significantly affected by strong winds or the opening and closing of doors.

The system fusing an IMU sensor and a barometer can reduce large fluctuations over short periods. The graph below shows a comparison of the altitude estimation data between the barometer and the IMU/barometer fusion system. It seems that there is a time delay in the IMU and the Barometer fusion data due to the Kalman filter. However, the effect of noise reduction is quite good.

Once you can obtain a stable altitude, you can achieve a more precise measurement of height between two different positions.
If altitude is measured with only one device, the value will be significantly affected by weather conditions over long periods.
If you can set a base sensor on the ground and a hand-carried sensor with you, you can get a precise height from the ground 
by taking the difference between the value of the base sensor and the value of the hand-carried sensor.
In my experiments, the accuracy achieved to Â±0.15 m.

# Hardware Configuration
Here is the hardware configuration for the Altimeter system. The base altimeter and the hand-carried altimeter are the same system. But in my case, I used the Spresense LTE-M Extension board to get the small form factor to do the test easily. It means that you can also use LTE-M for communication.

# Software Configuration
For details about the Spresense development environment, please visit [this site](https://developer.sony.com/spresense). 
You can find a bunch of technical documents

The driver for BMI270 used a part of [this Arduino library](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_BMI270_BMM150) 
and added a minor modification to select the I2C device address in the begin function.

The driver for BMP581 used [this Sparkfun Arduino library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_BMP581_Arduino_Library)

### Sensor Fusion Filter for Altitude Estimation
Altimeter estimates altitude by a two-step Kalman/Complimentary filter fusing values of the barometer, the accelerometer, and the gyroscope.
The implementation of the two-step Kalman/Complementary filter comes [here](https://github.com/juangallostra/AltitudeEstimation/tree/master), 
and the algorithm is explained in [this paper](https://simondlevy.academic.wlu.edu/files/2022/11/TwoStepFilter.pdf).

There are five parameters for the filter. It should be calibrated for each use case. For a pedestrian case, the parameter ranges are as follows:

<br/>

*Table. Parameters for Kalman/Complimentary filter*
| Parameter      | Description | Typical Range | Default value |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| AccelSigma     | Sigma value of Acceleration Sensor  | 0.03 - 0.001  | 0.01 | 
| GyroSigma      | Sigma value of Gyroscope   | 0.03 - 0.001  |  0.01 |
| BaroSigma      | Sigma value of Barometer   | 0.1 - 0.01  | 0.03 |
| ConstantAccel  | The constant acceleration value for a model in the Kalman Filter  | 0.2 - 0.05  | 0.1  | 
| AccelThreshold | Threshold value of the acceleration to reset the offset caused by sensor drift  | 0.05 - 0.005  | 0.02  | 

<br/>

These parameters should be set for the use case that you want to apply. Please do the experiments to fix these value before the deployment.
For the details of the contant acceleration and the threshold value of the acceleration, 
please refer to [this paper](https://simondlevy.academic.wlu.edu/files/2022/11/TwoStepFilter.pdf).

### Differential measurement
If you want to measure the height of two different points, you can refer to the diff_altitude example. 
The example contains the base_altimeter, the device_altimeter, and Python programs using [the bleak library](https://bleak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
The BLE device on Spresense to connect the BLE central on a Host PC running Python program above is [BLE1507](https://crane-elec.co.jp/products/vol-24/).
You can get the Arduino library from [here](https://github.com/TE-YoshinoriOota/BLE1507_Arduino)

### Overview of Altimeter Library

The Altimeter library is started by calling the "begin" function. The device addresses of the BMI270 and BMP581 can be specified through the arguments of the begin function.

Before sensing altitude, the altimeter should be calibrated by calling "startCalibration." Depending on the environment, this process can take tens of seconds. The end of calibration can be detected by calling the "isCalibrated" function. "startCalibration" can set a timeout, but the default is no timeout. The calibration algorithm uses two parameters: the calibration conversion threshold value of the fluctuation of the Kalman/Complementary filter output, and the differential threshold value between the barometer output and the filter output. The "setCalibConversionThresh" function can set the calibration conversion threshold value, and the "setCalibDiffThresh" function can set the differential threshold value. These functions should be called before "startCalibration" if you want to change these parameters.

The "startSensing" starts sensing altitude. The sensing process has two stages. The first stage is to accumulate sensed and estimated altitude data, the second stage is to calculate and filter the accumulated altitude data. The updated altitude data is processed using an IIR Filter and an Average Filter. The sample number of the Average Filter can be calculated by the update interval time divided by the sensing interval time. The default is 50 samples (= 1000 msec / 20 msec) There are two ways to end sensing altitude, the one way is to set the monitoring time specifying the argument of "startSensing", and the other way is to call "endSensing".  

The important parameters for the Kalman/Complementary filter can be set by the functions of "setAccelSigma", "setGyroSigma", "setBaroSigma", "setConstantAccel", "setAccelThreshold". For the technical background of these parameters, please refer to [this paper](https://simondlevy.academic.wlu.edu/files/2022/11/TwoStepFilter.pdf).

"setSeaLevelPressure" can set the sea level pressure value. If you can get the sea level pressure value through the internet, you may acquire precise altitude values. The default value is 1013.25 Pa for tentative.

The "getTemperature" and "getPressure" return BMP581 output. These values are filtered by an IIR filter and an average filter if they are enabled.
The "getAltitude" returns the estimated altitude value. In the barometer mode, it returns the altitude value estimated by the barometer value. In the fusion mode, it returns the altitude value estimated by Kalman/Complementary filter value.
